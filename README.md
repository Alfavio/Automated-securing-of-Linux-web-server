[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/243737.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/243737)

This is a hardening script to configure and harden Linux Ubuntu Servers after a clean installation. It installs and configures OpenSSH, Apache 2.4, MariaDB 10.3 and PHP 7.2. It also configures Linux, specifically the firewall, passwords, filesystem, network protocols, kernel, permissions, uninstalls unnecessary packages and installs and configures recommended security programs.

## Getting Started

### Requirements :construction:

Before you run the script, make sure that you fulfill the following requirements:

1. Clean installation of the Ubuntu Server 16.04.4 64-bit *(also works on Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 64-bit, other Ubuntu versions are not tested)*.
2. Stable internet connection.
3. Execution permission for [script.sh](script.sh).
4. You are logged in as a user with root privileges *(not **root** user, because you will not be able to log in via the SSH.* `PermitRootLogin` *will be disabled)*.

If you are not logged in as a user with root privileges and you didn't create it yet, you can do it by running the following commands:

```
adduser USERNAME
usermod -aG sudo USERNAME
su USERNAME
```

### Usage :white_check_mark:

You can execute the script with the following command:

```
sudo chmod a+x script.sh && sudo ./script.sh
```
or
```
sudo chmod a+x script.sh
sudo ./script.sh
```
